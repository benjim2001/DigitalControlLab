read the last read me files.
in addition, we use three controllers in row.
that means we dedicate some few seconds for each one and they perform independently.

These 3 controllers gains:
        kp1=25
        ki1=0
        kd1=1

        kp2=8
        ki2=0
        kd2=0.5

        kp3=20
        ki3=0.05
        kd3=1

Dedicates time:
2(s)  First rotation
4(s)  Walking to ball
2(s)  Second rotation
